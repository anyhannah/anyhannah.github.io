  I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Rochester in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/). My research spans across Natural Language Understanding/Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, I work on mining commonsense knowledge and organizing world knowledge into schemas to reflect the relational understanding between entities as well as between knowledge and action with [Len Schubert](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~schubert/). I also work on detecting and recovering semantically compressed forms, including ellipsis, with [Aaron Steven White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/).

          I work on obtaining commonly assumed knowledge about objects from various sources and representing the acquired knowledge in a formalized knowledge representation, called a schema. My work focuses on capturing <mark>lexical knowledge</mark>, such as hypernyms, properties, and usage information, to enable AI's human-like reasoning.

          What do you mean by you think so?
        description: |
         I also work on making the underlying meaning of semantically compressed forms explicit, both in text and semantic graphs. The scope of the project is not just limited to <mark>elliptical utterances</mark> such as verb phrase ellipsis, but also covers non-elliptical referring expressions such as null complement anaphora.

         I was involved in [FACTS.lab](http://factslab.io/)'s [MegaAttitude Project](http://megaattitude.io/) for building lexicon-scale datasets from crowdsourcing and studying the <mark>semantic contribution</mark> of lexical items and syntactic structures.
